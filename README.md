Repo includes my config for neovim, tmux, eww, hyprland, and more

It is not expected that this will work for you, if you want to get it to work figure it out. This repo's purpose is just for me to manage my dotfiles across my laptop and desktop.
Feel free to take inspiration from anything I've done, though!
